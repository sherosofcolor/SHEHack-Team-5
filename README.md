ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

Inspiration

    Most fitness apps are designed with cisgender male bodies in mind, often overlooking the impact of menstrual cycles on fitness routines. Many people with periods are unaware that working out around their cycle can boost energy levels, improve body recovery, reduce PMS symptoms, and balance hormones. Our mission is to bridge this gap by creating a fitness platform that educates and empowers users with cycle-aware workout plans tailored to their body's natural rhythm.

Impact of the Solution

    FitSync is a platform designed to create optimal workout plans tailored to an individual's menstrual cycle. It ensures users receive workouts that support their body's changing needs throughout the cycle, improving both physical and mental well-being.

    Key Features:
        Cycle-Based Workout Plans: Align workouts with menstrual phases for optimal results.

        Personalized Fitness Guidance: Adaptable routines based on user input and activity levels.

        User-Friendly Interface: Clean, intuitive UI for seamless navigation.

        Future Expansion: Plans to integrate machine learning to analyze user preferences and cycle data for more refined and intelligent workout recommendations.


Tech Stack Used:

    Frontend: React.js, CSS, Bootstrap

    Backend: Flask ( Python )

    Database: MongoDB

    UI/UX: Figma, Canva
